Anastasia is the first installment of server configurations under the Tsarchild project.

The goals of Anastasia:
1. Run a single script to install a baseline nginx server that provides access to a few services:
  - a base index homepage under `/`
  - Three availabe games (in progress): Snake, Minesweeper, and Blackjack under `/games`
  - A share directory under `/share`
2. Possibly setup a strapi server and gatsby server, or move to second server iteration
