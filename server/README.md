# Server Collection

This folder will soon be moved to its own repo.

The goal of the server collection is to provide premade server configurations for quick starting nginx servers.

The three primary goals are to:
1. Gain a deeper understanding of running an nginx server
2. Provide something like a snapshot for differenct setups in case (when) I screw something up, I can quickly reboot the system without worrying about the intimidating process
3. Maintain a static web presence. 

The servers will likely reside on a domain called `tsarchild.com`, a side project and home for the random collection of code and server snapshots.
Tsarchild pays homage to Ace Frehley, aka Space Ace, aka Star Child, and also Russian history. 

That is why the first iteration of server config is named "Anastasia", the daughter of the last Tsar of Russia, Tsar Nicholas II of the infamous Romanov Dynasty.
